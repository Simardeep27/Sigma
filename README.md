# Sigma
Df having 5 columns - product_code,date,warehouse,order_demand
(description provided in the file about the columns)
# Data cleaning
Contained more than 10000 null dates in the df, removed the columns , the order demand had several extra string , removed it. Dont think that labelencoder is required.
Doesnt need more cleaning in my opinion. Open to suggestions
# Next steps:
1.Feature preprocessing(if required)
2.Data Visualisation(IMP)
3.Main model for forecasting(IMP)
4.Gaining Insights
5.Presentation containing Strategic Solutions
